I recommend installing everything with [ALCOM](https://vrc-get.anatawa12.com/alcom/) (Alternative Creator Companion)

### Dependencies
- VRCSDK for Avatars `v3.7.4+`
- [Modular Avatar](https://github.com/bdunderscore/modular-avatar) ([NDMF](https://github.com/bdunderscore/ndmf)) by [bd_](https://github.com/bdunderscore)
  - Used for menu generation, animator merging (via MaAc).
- [Animator as Code](https://github.com/hai-vr/av3-animator-as-code) (Core, VRC, MA) by [Hai](https://www.patreon.com/c/vr_hai/posts)
  - Used for animator generation, animation generation, VRC parameter generation, and animator merging.

**Optional Dependencies**
- Poiyomi (Pro or Toon)
  - Poiyomi is optional, but is used for most Material / Shader tools. Pro is also optional but required for SSAO.

### Install

[Add the package to VCC / ALCOM](https://vpm.angelware.net)
